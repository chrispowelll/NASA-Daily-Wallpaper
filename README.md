## Running This Program
Update line 14 to choose the directory where you want to store your daily photo. Eg. "C:\\\Users\\yourUsername\\\Pictures\\\nasaWallpapers\\\". Photos are cleared to save space after each day, however you can copy the daily picture elsewhere if you want to retain it.

I recommend auto-running this program from Startup. It runs in the command line and only takes a few seconds. Internet connection is required.

Currently, it works on Windows 10.
